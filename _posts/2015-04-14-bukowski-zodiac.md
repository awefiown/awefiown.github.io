*Aries: “We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.”*   

**Taurus: “What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone.”**   

*Gemini: “And I laugh, I can still laugh, who can’t laugh when the whole thing is so ridiculous, that only the insane, the clowns, the half-wits, the cheaters, the whores, the horseplayers, the bankrobbers, the poets … are interesting?”*   

**Cancer: “People in love often become edgy, dangerous. They lose their sense of perspective.”**   

*Leo: “I wanted the whole world or nothing.”*   

**Virgo: “To create art means to be crazy alone forever.”**   

*Libra: “I never felt right being alone; sometimes it felt good but it never felt right.”*   

**Scorpio: “Find what you love and let it kill you.”**   

*Sagittarius: “Your eyes - they’re beautiful. They’re wild, crazy, like some animal peering out of a forest on fire.”*   

**Capricorn: “People don’t need love. What they need is success in one form or another. It can be love but it needn’t be.”**   

*Aquarius: “Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.”*  

**Pisces: “I stopped looking for a Dream Girl, I just wanted one that wasn’t a nightmare.”**
