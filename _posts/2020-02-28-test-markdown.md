Man is that being in whom highest spirit and lowest matter are linked together by a special intelligence. We can envision him as a living peak for the three wavelengths of evolution to converge: spirit, matter, and the linking intellect. Man is the one who unifies the self, the not-self, and the relation between them; and he is seen to be all at once: the knower, that which is known, and knowledge.

Now as for the purpose of the intellect: Surely it is suited for adapting the material form to the needs of the spirit. Surely it is responsible for maintenance of its own contradictory nature. Naturally, we can expect it to have a third purpose too; though it remains to be seen how ONENESS ought to be concluded. Man, woman, or god only knows whether its importance is cemented by the singling of ONE of the three aspects to rule over them all or by the synthesising of a new ONE from combining equal parts of all three prior aspects.

In a very old occult book—so old it is unknown which year it was written— there can be found a definition of man which is very illuminating, in line with the thoughts seeking form this Gemini season. Man is there defined as: "the Life and the lives."---



This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
