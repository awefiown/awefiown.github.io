*Synaesthesia* is a neurological condition in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive
pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.
Syn. Aes. The. Sia. The *sharp taste* of cheddar cheese. The *loud pattern* on the tourist’s shirt.
Syn-aes-the-sia: The tip of the tongue snakes and slides in your palate to sneak, at three, a smile.
The reason a woman *hears* melted golden butter in her husband’s voice, *feels* on her fingertips
the scorching heat of the colour scarlet. It’s what we diagnose those with a gift for figurative
language — poets who write about *dark sounds* and *bitter laughs* and *blazing eyes*. Synaesthesia
is a most luscious word on the tongue with tantamount poetic meaning: it is the ability to see the
intricate scaffolds of spoken words and climb them, to paint your own thoughts on the marble
ceiling. More than a neurological condition, it is allowing the self to sense the poetry of
our existence.
